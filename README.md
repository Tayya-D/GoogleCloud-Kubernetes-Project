# End-to-End Cloud Infrastructure Project for AI Company Application

This project will demonstrate your expertise in Kubernetes, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), multi-cloud (AWS & GCP) deployment, while focusing on scalability, reliability, security, and continuous improvement - all critical for an AI infrastructure role.

## Project Overview: AI Model Serving Platform

We'll build a scalable, secure platform for serving machine learning models with these components:
- Multi-cloud Kubernetes clusters (EKS on AWS, GKE on GCP)
- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform and Pulumi
- CI/CD pipelines for both infrastructure and application deployment
- Monitoring, logging, and security controls
- Auto-scaling and reliability features

## Phase 1: Design & Planning

### 1. Requirements Definition
- **Scalability**: Handle from 10 to 10,000 requests/sec
- **Reliability**: 99.99% uptime SLA
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption, RBAC, network policies
- **Multi-cloud**: Deployable on AWS and GCP
- **Cost Optimization**: Auto-scaling with cost awareness

### 2. Architecture Design
```
[Diagram would show:]
- Users -> Cloudflare/CDN -> WAF -> Load Balancer
- -> Kubernetes Ingress (Istio) 
- -> Pods (Model Serving, Feature Store, Monitoring)
- -> Backend Services (Redis, Postgres)
- -> Cloud Storage (S3/GCS)
- All with VPCs, security groups, IAM
```

Let me guide you through building this project step-by-step with exact file locations, code examples with explanations, and implementation order. I'll structure this as a hands-on tutorial.

## **Phase 1: Setup & AWS Infrastructure**
### **1. Initialize Project Structure**
```bash
mkdir -p ai-model-serving-platform/{.github/workflows,aws/terraform,gcp/pulumi,k8s/{base,overlays/prod,security},scripts,docs}
cd ai-model-serving-platform
git init
```
